# SortingNetworks
Interactive creation (manual / automatic) of sorting networks.
A standard project should contain:
a properly implemented OOP model;
a Swing or JavaFX graphical user interface; Web applications with a Java backend are also accepted;
communication with a relational database; No-sql, object-oriented or graph databases are also accepted; storing data as xml or json is also acceptable;
an algorithmic part - a higher level of complexity increases the value of the project.
any other additional technologies can increase the value of the project (REST services, network programming, multi-threading, etc.)
